Anokha gave me an oppurtunity to perform on stage. The second day of the Anokha tech fest was the NATYA NIGHT, also knows as the dance night. Performed, by the university's dance club 'Natya Sudha', the fest had a night enjoyed by everyone. I am in the Jhalak team of Natyasudha club. We gave a wonderful performance on 5 different songs. We were also the first ones to perform on stage. We had performed on 5 different bollywood songs from different movies. The team leader had always supported all of us and gave all her time in the performances.
Multiple groups had performed that day. There were around 10 groups that performed on stage that day. From which there were around 6 girls groups and 3 boy groups and one which had both boys and girls. All these performance were done by the dance club of the university. Dance styles such as classical, bollywood, contemporary, jazz and many more were performed.

    The auditorium was filled with cheers and music all around. Viewers had started dancing. We loved the fact that people loved our performance. We loved their reactions, as their reaction made us enjoy more. I would like to perform more on stage. Everyone enjoyed that day. It was one the of the most memorable days of my college life.
