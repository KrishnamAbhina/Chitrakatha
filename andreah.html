  We loved her performance. She was so friendly with all the students. All the students danced with her music. It was also raining that day, which made it more memorable and amazing. All my friends an I were singing loudly and dancing in the rain. We had so much fun. She ended the concert with her last and most famous song 'Oo Solrya' from the film Pushpa.
