                    It is with great pleasure that we are presenting the very first issue of our new e-magazine ''Chitra Katha' - a quarterly chemical science magazine published by the Department of Chemistry, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri.
         <br>
         <br>This inaugural issue contains four main articles from our faculty members, all the four articles cover four very different aspects of chemistry and evidence the multifaceted nature of chemistry and versatility in its applications. We also have a set of ‘chemistry activity bits’ collected by our masters’ student, Ms. Sweta Anantharaman to help boost general chemistry knowledge and keep the reader entertained.
         <br>
         <br>
         We hope that, this issue will attract the readership of scholars and the common public alike and help to popularize chemistry reading and writing habit among all Amritians and others.
