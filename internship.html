    Getting an internship is like getting a full time job, and as an intern you can be considered a full time employee. However, due to the short term nature of the job, being an intern can be a bit daunting at first. This guide is meant to tackle those challenges and make it easier for an intern to get acclimated to their new work environment quickly and efficiently so they can start doing meaningful and productive work.
    This is an obvious first step, but one worth mentioning. Sometimes the thought of even getting an internship can be a challenge for some people. But by having a clean resume, going to career fairs and professional conferences, and presenting yourself professionally many students can attain an internship.

    You want to make sure you clear up what your start and end dates will be, the work site you will be working on, and what you should have ready by the first day of work orientation.
    On your first day of work you will likely attend a daylong orientation process, which officially makes you an intern for the summer. Here you will likely get your employee badge, necessary work equipment (like a laptop, monitors, workstation, etc), and get to meet other interns or coworkers. This is a good day to take it easy and meet new people in your work network.
    Even if you do not work with someone directly on their team, it is very possible that you will work with them indirectly through projects or collaborations, so you want to make sure you make a good impression with your new coworkers.
    Even after going through orientation on your first day and setting up your workstation, you might still need a few more resources to actually start doing productive work. Talk with your manager about your scope of work in the team and what you are expected to deliver. Ask your manager and coworkers what software tools and extra resources are required, and if there are any rights or permissions you require to be approved to perform the job effectively without too many obstacles.

    By now you should have a pretty good understanding of the kind of work you and your coworkers do and how it affects other teams and the company as a whole. Your team might be composed of smaller sub-teams, each of which focuses on a specific project, or it might be the case that every member of the team works towards a large scale and long-term project that requires regular updates. Whatever the case may be make sure you find your role in the team.
    
    I started preparing for this in my second year. I worked hard and made contacts. With the guidance of my mentors, i crached the code and got into microsoft as an intern!Additionally, you will possibly have new employee trainings that you have to get out of the way before you do productive work. If your manager and work permit it, ask for VPN access on your laptop so that you may do work from home.
